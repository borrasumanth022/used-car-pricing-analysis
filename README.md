# Used Car Pricing Analysis

This project analyzes a Kaggle dataset of used cars to understand what factors drive the resale price of a car.  
The analysis follows the CRISP-DM process: data preparation, visualization, modeling, and deployment of findings.  

## Key Findings
- **Condition matters most**: Cars in "fair" condition sell for ~80% less than those in "excellent" condition.  
- **Year matters**: Each additional year reduces value by about 30% on average.  
- **Title status**: Salvage titles reduce price by ~40%.  
- **Brand reputation**: Premium brands (Audi, BMW, Toyota) retain more value; economy brands (Mazda, Chrysler) sell for less.  
- **Fuel type**: Diesel cars are worth ~10‚Äì15% more; hybrids/EVs show strong resale value.  
- **Location matters**: Cities like Boston, Knoxville, and Grand Rapids command higher resale values.  

## Recommendations for Dealers
1. **Inventory Strategy**: Prioritize ‚Äúlike new‚Äù cars, clean titles, and premium brands.  
2. **Pricing Strategy**: Set stronger price bands for newer models and diesels; discount aggressively in LA, hold firm in Boston.  
3. **Operations**: Recondition cars into ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù status where possible; expand EV/hybrid inventory.
